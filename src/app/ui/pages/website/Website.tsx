                "Creating a website involves several key steps, starting with
                planning your site's purpose and audience. Once you've outlined
                your goals, choose a website builder or coding platform that
                suits your technical skill level. If you're using a builder like
                WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace, you can select from a variety of
                templates and customize them with your content. For those coding
                from scratch, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be your foundation.
                Focus on designing a user-friendly layout, incorporating
                responsive design for mobile users, and ensuring easy
                navigation. Don't forget to optimize your site for SEO and
                performance, and finally, publish it with a reliable hosting
                service."
